# Yoobic Details Card Readme

Made with StencilJS

This component was not mandatory to be made but I wanted to experiment with more complex components than a simple grid.

Props:

- Name
- Image
- Info (Those info are displayed by the Yoobic Basic Grid)

**npm package**: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/yoobic-basic-grid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yoobic-basic-grid)
