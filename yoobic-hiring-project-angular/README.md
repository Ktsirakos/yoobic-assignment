# Yoobic angular project Readme

Made with Ionic/Angular

This is the application in which the Yoobic Details Card is used.

### How to install

```jsx
npm install
ionic serve
```

### Usage

The application has a list of Star Wars characters on the home page.

The list is fetched via HTTP GET from [https://swapi.dev/](https://swapi.dev/).

The list is then mapped in order to keep only:

- Name
- Height
- Mass
- Gender
- Hair Color
- Eye color
- Number of films

After those fields are being displayed by using the Yoobic Details Card (which uses the Yoobic Basic Grid).

**HAVE FUN!**
